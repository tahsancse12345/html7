     	<h1>Solving the Mystery of Emotional Labor: It’s Trickier Than You Think</h1>
     	<P>We know that most jobs require a measure of physical and/or mental labor to execute them properly. And we should have a good idea of how much labor is required ahead of time. But there are a good number of jobs that also require something called emotional labor.
